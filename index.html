      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">Welcome to my website, I am currently a final year ECE student working towards kickstarting my career.</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <h3>Java Programming</h3>
        <img class="coding" src="images/coding.png"  alt="Coding Image">
        <p>I started coding in java when I was 12. From school to college, it is the only thing that has been a constant in my technical area. Although I had a gap due to my college curriculum where I had to learn Python programming, C and C++ programming languages before diving into Java again. I wish to be a core java programmer with good skills.</p>

        <h3>Front-End Web Development</h3>
        <img class="webdev" src="images/website.png"  alt="website image">
        <p>I started taking interest in web development when I came across various attractive websites which people made for themselves and some organisations who would make interactive and attractive website designs. Currently I am a Front-End Web Development enthusiast but I'll work on to develop skills on Back-End Web Development to be finally able to become a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

        <h3>Musician/Guitarist</h3>
        <p>I have been playing guitar since 2011(when I was 10 years old). I started with an acoustic guitar which I played for three and a half years and then I upgraded to an electric guitar which I have been playing since 2015. I aspire to be a Musician one day and to create my own music for the world to hear.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <img class="camera" src="images/camera.png"  alt="Tree Photo at Twilight">
        <p>My photography journey started when I got my own phone and I was obsessed with clicking different types of pictures from different angles, for most instances I had to borrow a camera from my friends to be able to shoot as I have no camera of my own, but that doesn't stop me from clicking pictures that makes me happy from inside. Currently a mobile shooter, but want to step up my game to mirrorless in the "not so distant" future.</p>
